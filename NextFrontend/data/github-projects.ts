    longDescription: "This project is a blockchain-powered amortization calculator that allows users to compute monthly EMIs and interest distribution based on loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. The backend is powered by a smart contract written in Solidity and deployed on the Sepolia testnet using Hardhat and Alchemy. The frontend, built with React.js and styled using Bootstrap, interacts with the smart contract via Web3.js. Users can input loan details and get a detailed monthly breakdown of principal and interest payments, making the loan repayment process transparent and decentralized.",

    longDescription: "This is an innovative NFT minting dApp that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Users can either upload their own image or generate one using AI via the Hugging Face API, and mint it as an NFT by paying a minting fee. The smart contract, written in Solidity and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, handles the minting, burning, and withdrawal logic. Once an NFT is burned, users can reclaim their minting amount from the contract. The application is built with React.js, Node.js, and Web3.js, and uses Wagmi and WalletConnect for seamless wallet integration. IPFS (via Pinata) is used to store image data in a decentralized manner.",

Users can choose from various staking packages (e.g., X tokens for Y days at Z% profit), and after the lock period, they can withdraw their initial stake along with the earned rewards. The platform also includes an admin dashboard where the administrator can add, update, or remove staking packages dynamically. The application uses Solidity for smart contracts, Hardhat for development, and React.js for the frontend. Wallet connectivity and transactions are handled using Wagmi, WalletConnect, and Web3.js, and the project is deployed on the Sepolia testnet via Alchemy.",

The backend logic is handled through chaincode written in Golang, allowing users to store and manage data securely on the blockchain. The frontend is developed in React.js, enabling users to interact with the blockchain and view stored records dynamically. CouchDB is used as the state database, and the network uses Raft for consensus. A detailed demo is available on YouTube that walks through the entire setup and chaincode lifecycle using automated bash scripts for deployment and execution.",
